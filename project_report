PROJECT REPORT 
SMART STUDY TIME PREDICTOR USING MACHINE LEARNING

1. INTODUCTION
Time management is one the biggest problems for student, studnets struggle to manage their time and decide how many hours they should study for a particular topic. 
This project uses simple Machine Learning (Linear Regression) to predict the numbers of hours for study based on factors like difficulty, number of chapters and past score.
This is beginner friendly project

2. OBJECTIVES
The main of this program involves:
    To develop a simple and user friendly software collecting basic information.
    To students to estimate study time more accurately
    To develop a practical student assistance tool
    To build a predictive model using python.

3. PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Students struggle to plan their study schedule because:
    Some chapters are difficult than other
    Their previous performance affects the effort needed 
    They do not have the system to calculate study times

4. SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
     Suitable for college/school students
     Useful for making timetable
     Can be integrated in websites, app or study palnners

5. IMPLEMENTATION
5.1 Program Structure 
     Takes number of chapters
     Difficulty Level
     Past scores

5.2 Sample code overview 
#SMART STUDY TIME PREDICTOR
#Using Linear Regression
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression


data=np.array([
    [5,3,60],
    [8,4,55],
    [3,2,80],
    [10,5,50],
    [7,4,65],
])

response=np.array([5,8,3,10,7])

model=LinearRegression()
model.fit(data,response)

print("\n-----------------------------------")
print("SMART STUDY TIME PREDICTOR")
print("-----------------------------------")


chapter=int(input("Enter number of chapters: "))
difficulty=int(input("Enter difficulty level (1-5): "))
past_score=int(input("Enter your previous score (%): "))

input=np.array([[chapter, difficulty, past_score]])

predicted_hour=model.predict(input)[0]

print("\n Suggested Study Time: ")
print(f"You should study approx: {predicted_hour:.2f} hours")

if predicted_hour<4:
  print("You need moderate preparation")
elif predicted_hour<7:
  print("You need good preparation")
else:
  print("You need strong preparation. Stay consistent!")



6. RESULT 

-----------------------------------
SMART STUDY TIME PREDICTOR
-----------------------------------
Enter number of chapters: 5
Enter difficulty level (1-5): 3
Enter your previous score (%): 87

 Suggested Study Time: 
You should study approx: 5.00 hours
You need good preparation
