PROJECT STATEMENT

• Project Title : Smart Study Time Predictor

• Submitted By : Ruba Nizam Khan

• College : VIT Bhopal University

Scope This project, called the Smart Study Time Predictorr aims to develop a Python application using Machine Learning (Linear Regression) that will assist students in generating how many hours they should study on a topic. 
The main problem that students usually face involves determining the amount of time they should devote to studies due to variation in the difficulty level of topics and dependence on previous performances, which might affect effort. The objective of this study is to solve this problem by providing an approximate but data-driven prediction of study hours using a Linear Regression algorithm.

The input include the number of chapters, difficulty level on a scale from 1 to 5, and a student's previous score. Given these inputs, the model predicts recommended study time using weighted learning patterns from a small dataset. As a result, the student gets a clearer and more accurate, personalized estimate about how much time they need to prepare.
